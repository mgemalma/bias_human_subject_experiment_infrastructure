# Crowdsourced Label Aggregation with Confirmation Bias Mitigation

This repository supports the data collection infrastructure for the research project *"Accounting for Confirmation Bias in Crowdsourced Label Aggregation"*, which investigates how confirmation bias affects crowdsourced label quality and proposes a novel algorithm to account for this bias in aggregating crowd annotations. This research explores human bias in crowd annotation and aims to enhance the reliability of human-in-the-loop systems by accurately inferring task ground truths while considering cognitive biases.

### Abstract
*Collecting large-scale human-annotated datasets via crowdsourcing is crucial for training and improving automated models in human-in-the-loop AI systems. However, biases, particularly confirmation bias, can affect data quality and, consequently, model performance. This paper presents a bias-aware label aggregation algorithm that factors in crowd workers' varying levels of confirmation bias, enhancing ground-truth inference from crowdsourced data. Real-world and synthetic data evaluations demonstrate the algorithm's advantage over baseline methods in tasks where workers exhibit confirmation bias.*

### Overview
This repository provides the web application and backend infrastructure to collect crowd-sourced annotations. The web app is built on Meteor, following a structure similar to other crowd annotation systems, and includes templates and JavaScript files to facilitate data collection across various user interactions.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mgemalma/bias_human_subject_experiment_infrastructure
    cd bias_human_subject_experiment_infrastructure
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) are installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

#### Starting the Application
- **Run the Meteor App**:
    ```bash
    meteor
    ```
    This command starts the server locally for testing and development.

#### Observing Database Changes
To monitor real-time updates in MongoDB, open a separate terminal and run:
```bash
meteor mongo
```

#### Running the Web App
Access the app locally through a structured URL format:

```plaintext
http://localhost:3000/?workerId=<worker_id>&assignmentId=<assignment_id>&hitId=<hit_id>&turkSubmitTo=<submission_url>
```
## Deployment

To deploy the Meteor app locally, use the following example commands to set up the environment variables and start the application. **Note:** Adjust these commands according to your specific setup; the following is just an example.

```bash
# Set the port number for the application
port_num='127.0.0.1:3000'

# Set the root URL for the application
root_url='https://yourdomain.com/yourapp'

# Export the ROOT_URL and BIND_UP variables
export ROOT_URL=$root_url
export BIND_UP=$port_num

# Start the Meteor app on the specified port
meteor run --port $port_num

# Notify deployment completion
echo "Deployment finished"
```
